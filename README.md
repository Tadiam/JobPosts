When applying for jobs in and around the tech industry, titles of postings are not always standard. There’s nuances to each position that differs from company to company. “Quality Engineer” or “Program Manager” at one place may not mean the same thing as at another. The qualifications, experiences, and job details may make them seem like completely different jobs, despite their shared title. This may negatively impact people’s job search experience, especially if they do not have a high level industry knowledge, despite being qualified. Our model will take a set of qualifications, salary expectations, and other job search criteria to recommend candidates with jobs that fits their search criteria and resume, not just one that has a similar title to what they’ve already applied to.
